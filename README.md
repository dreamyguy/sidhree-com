I created this project as a way to give back some of what I've learned to the open-source community. It was about time I put up a simple page with my details, so why not share.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```shell
$ npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```shell
$ npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```shell
$ npm build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
